# Learn Lua

A helloworld project for learning Lua lang. Nothing fancy though. If I'm in the
mood, maybe I will try something challenging. It seems that Wireshark use Lua
as its scripting language.

This could be used as the basis for learning other languages in the future.
Projects included in this repo are:

- an incremental files for copy/paste syntax and see the result immediately
- a simple game. here we write tictactoe
- a real-world application. here we choose Wireshark, due to the nature of Lua
as an embedding language, and Wireshark is an useful application
